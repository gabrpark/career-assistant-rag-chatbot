Vinita, the senior who I met yesterday, sent a group message on LI, including a senior contact who was not on my list. She introduced me to him, sounding like a job seeker. I drafted my message following your comments on one of Luna's recent posts, where she faced a similar situation. Could you help me with this conversation? 

Btw, I haven't yet sent her a thank you message.

**Vinita:**
Hi Gaurav,
Please meet Gabriel. He is a recent college graduate looking for engineering roles in data science, ML and AI space. I thought I will introduce him to you as you may be able to find a good match in his skills for the roles you are looking to hire. 
I will leave it between you two to take it forward from here.
Regards,
Vinita

**Gaurav:**
Thanks

I'll send the profile to our recruiting team

Nice to meet you Gabriel

Hi Stuart, Gaurav accepted my connection request since we wrote the following message in the group during our weekly workshop. He did not reply to that message again, so I sent him a coffee chat request message since he accepted my connection request after he saw our message. Could you please review my draft?

Dear Gaurav,

I wanted to introduce myself here and see if you had time to grab a coffee in October. 

I like to solve problems relating to data platforms and LLM application development. I have held end-to-end ML engineering roles.

I'm looking to meet more thought leaders in the SW engineering space. How does your October look for meeting up somewhere?

Dear Gaurav,

It's a pleasure to be introduced. I previously worked at a consulting company supporting the development of data platform for CPG industry, and I am currently building RAG chatbot. I'm interested in networking with more AI thought leaders.

Connect here?

Best Regards,
Gabriel

Hi, Gabriel

>Gabriel:
Dear Gaurav,

Thanks for accepting my request to connect!

A nice thing about networking is the chance to meet new people - it would be great to meet you.

I am exploring how AI can be leveraged to support other industries through data platforms and services. I am interested in discussing my professional situation or just to get some advice on it.

Would you be open to grabbing a coffee some time in October?

Dear Gaurav,

I’m climbing the mountain of data/AI software engineering—and one of the things I like the most is the opportunity to meet and learn from others in the field. I wanted to see if you might have some time in October to grab a coffee. I’d love to hear more about your work and get your advice on my current professional situation.

I understand schedules can get busy, so no rush—just wanted to reconnect whenever you have a moment.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Gabriel","created_time": "2024-10-08T22: 55: 37+0000","comments": {
