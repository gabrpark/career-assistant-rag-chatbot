I’m not quite sure if he is asking a specific question that needs to be answered, or I can just skip the details and request a coffee in person.\nI drafted a response, could you please take a look at it and see if adjustments needed? I\n\n—\nDear David,\nPrior to Yale I helped lead B2B strategy at LANDZ, the #1 ranked prop tech firm in local niche, growing annual GMV to $700M / yr. I’m interested in expanding my professional network.\nConnect here?\nJamie\n-\nDavid, thanks for connecting - appreciate it.\nIt looks like you’re doing great things at Microsoft. After Yale, I’ve been focused on B2B go-to-market strategy in the cloud-based enterprise software and digital solutions space.\nI’m interested in discussing my professional situation or just getting some advice on it.\nPlease note, I’m not asking for a job. You are in a unique position to offer valuable assistance, and I would be respectful of your time.\nWould you have time to grab an e-coffee?\nIf not, no problem.\nJamie\n-\nHis response:\n\nHi Jamie, B2B in what sense, mostly from a MSFT perspective is having B2B clients use our Azure cloud Marketplace Services to expand their potential TAM (Total Available Market), but at the end of the day it comes down to the product/service they are selling and what the value add is. Are you in NY as well, and yes interested in discussing futher.\n-\nMy drafted response:\n\nHi David, thanks for sharing your perspective. I totally agree—B2B success isn’t just about getting more clients or pushing more solutions, but really about creating a win-win where customers consistently derive value from what we offer. Understanding each customer’s unique business context and helping them solve their challenges has been a central focus of my work experience, and I’m looking to keep building on that.\nI’m around NYC and happy to explore that further when we meet. What's a good time and location for you?\nLook forward to it.\nBest,\nJamie",

He said yes. So move to the next step.\nThink about and draft a response and and I can comment?",
